# Security Audit of Internee.pk’s Website – Assignment 6

This repository contains **Assignment 6** of my **CSI‑619 Internship at Internee.pk**, focused on performing a **Security Audit** to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection using industry‑standard security practices.

---

## 🔹 Objective
The objective of this task is to identify common web application vulnerabilities and understand how security audits help protect user data and systems.

---

## 🔹 Security Testing Overview
The security audit focuses on identifying the following vulnerabilities:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross‑Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

---

## 🔹 Tools & Platforms Used
- OWASP Juice Shop (Vulnerable Web Application)
- OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite (Security Scanning Tools)
- OWASP Top 10 Security Risks

---

## 🔹 Testing Approach
Security testing was conducted on a **practice environment** using OWASP Juice Shop to avoid real‑world impact. Automated scanning tools were used to analyze potential vulnerabilities in login pages, user inputs, and APIs.
